Welcome to the future of non-innovation! Breadboard Simulator is a revolutionary web app that empowers you to build completely useless electronic gadgets. Forget solving world problemsâ€”here, we create them.

## Why?
Because we could. And because the world has enough useful things. It's time to embrace the art of pointlessness. This project was built for a hackathon where the only metric for success was making the judges laugh.

## Demo

## How to Achieve Uselessness
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run `npm install` to summon the necessary node modules from the digital ether.
3.  Run `npm start` to launch the simulator and begin your journey into technological absurdity.
4.  Drag, drop, and connect components.
5.  Marvel at your creation that does absolutely nothing.
6.  Export your masterpiece as a meme and share it with your friends, who will surely question your life choices.

## Environment Variables
We believe in simplicity. Just like our circuits, our setup requires nothing. No `.env` file needed. We are fueled by pure, unadulterated imagination (and a little bit of JavaScript).
